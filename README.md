## Reddit General Scraper

This code shows an example of a fairly general way to scrape reddit with the help of the [praw module](https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/stable/). Set your desired subreddit, number of threads, and number comments per thread tor record in `redditconfig.py` along with your MongoDB database and collection name. 

I used this script to keep track of Reddit's front page offerings for a few months. With this data, I was able to see what subreddits were the most popular and what their general trajectories were on the front page. You can see more of that work [here](https://github.com/sunnysideprodcorp/PlottingNonRectangularData)
